# NMR_Spectra_Edible_Oils
Benchtop (60 MHz) NMR magnitude spectra of undiluted Olive and Argan oils
A collection of NMR spectra acquired from 275 different samples of authentic olive (201) and argan oils (74).
Supplied as magnitude spectra in the chemical shift range ~0-10 ppm. 

The dataset comprises the collections of 'Olive' and 'Argan' oils from 'Batch 2, Lab 2' as detailed in "Mitigating instrument effects in 60Â MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy for authenticity screening of edible oils", Gunning Y, Taous F, El Ghali T, Gibbon JD, Wilson E, Brignall RM, Kemsley EK, Food Chemistry, 370, 202, 131333, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.131333.

Further details of argan oil samples given in "High-throughput screening of argan oil composition and authenticity using benchtop 1 H NMR"
